Welcome to the CozoScript Manual. The latest version of this manual can be read at https://cozodb.github.io/current/manual.
Alternatively, you can download a PDF version for offline viewing at https://cozodb.github.io/current/manual.pdf.

This manual touches upon all features currently accessible in the Cozo database via CozoScript,
though the coverage of some topics may be sketchy at this stage. In addition, the last chapter describes some functionalities
beyond CozoScript.

This manual assumes that you already know the basics of the Cozo database,
at the level of the `Tutorial <https://github.com/cozodb/cozo-docs/blob/main/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb>`_.
